# CodingBat Java Solutions

My solutions to Coding Bat Java Problems. 

## Thoughts

- Recommended order to tackle problems - start with Map & Functional (Mostly self-contained with little relevance to other problems),Logic 1, String 1, Logic 2, Array 1, Warmup 1 and 2, String 2, AP-1, Recursion 1, Recursion 2, String 3, Array 2, and Array 3.
- The string-1 section relies too heavily on the substring method.
- I had most difficulty with array 3.
- I tackled AP-1 problems too late - AP-1 helps understanding some Array 2 & 3 problems easier.
- I wasn't going to bother with the warmup problems (since they give you solutions) but they actually help you solve some of the more difficult problems in the higher categories.  
- A lot of my solutions were approaches that first came to mind.
- I did a lot of problems back to back at one time.  I slowed down for the more difficult categories and did a fair amount of research to help solve some problems.   
- There are poor directions for some problems. 
- There is a decent variety of solutions to these problems out there. 
- I didn't bother making classes and having proper formatted java code.
